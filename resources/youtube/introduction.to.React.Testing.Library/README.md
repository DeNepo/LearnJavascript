***Σε ποιες περιπτώσεις μπορεί να σπάσει το render(Component) call μέσα στα tests της React Testing Library;***

Some common conditions that might break a simple render(Component) call include:

1) Missing Dependencies: If the component being rendered relies on external dependencies (e.g., libraries, APIs, or global objects) that are not available in the testing environment, the render call might fail or produce unexpected results. In such cases, you may need to provide mock data or mock functions to simulate the behavior of those dependencies during testing.

2) Async Operations: If the component relies on asynchronous operations (e.g., fetching data from an API, using `setTimeout`, etc.), the render call might not wait for these operations to complete before asserting the component's behavior. This can lead to test failures or false positives. You should use `waitFor` or other asynchronous testing utilities provided by React Testing Library to handle such cases.
